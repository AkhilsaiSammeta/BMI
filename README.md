Body Mass Index Calculators: These websites provide a tool to calculate your Body Mass Index (BMI), a measure of body fat based on height and weight. They typically have a simple interface where you enter your height and weight, and then the website calculates your BMI and displays it along with a classification (e.g., underweight, overweight, obese).
